# 34bigthings_test

I implemented three custom mechanics:

- Shrink weapon
- Freezing weapon
- Jetpack

For facilitation the ammunition for **weap weapon** works for **freezing weapon** and the ammunition for **launcher weapon** works with **shrink weapon**.
It has been made so that ammunition is not replaced in every map.
